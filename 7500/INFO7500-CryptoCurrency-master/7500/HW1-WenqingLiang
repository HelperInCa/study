Question 4: SMS text game
	
Alice can "hash" the number in her head and send the hash to Bob in SMS text.

An example of hashing mechanisim (if she thinks 9 in head):
1. Change the number from decimal to binary (9 ----> 1001)
2. Randomly choose 2 numbers from 0-9 and concatenate them with the binary string at the beginning (choose 4 and 7:  1001---->471001)
3. Transform the new number to hexadecimal as the hash (471001 ----> 72FD9)
4. Send the hash to Bob in SMS text

In step 2 the numbers chosen can be different each round of the game.
