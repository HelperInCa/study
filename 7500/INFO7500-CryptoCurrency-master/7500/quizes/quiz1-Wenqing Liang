1.b c d 

2. Change the legal documents into bit string --> convert it to 64-based ---> pass through hash function and check the remainder

3. Because in the commitment, the original message needs to be hidden by concatenating with the nonce and passes through hash function. If a nonce is not used and the message is passed through hash function directly (example: head/tail), it is possible to figure out what the original message is by trying most common values.

The nonce has to be chosen randomly from a distribution that has high min-entropy so that it's hard to be figured out.

4. Choice b takes longer to solve because the target set of Y  (100-bit values) is smaller.



Answers:

1. c

2. This hash function cannot be used for this purpose because it has easy-to-find collisions.

3. A nonce should only be used once and must be random. The nonce is needed in case the

values to be committed do not come from a spread-out set. Appending the nonce to the value makes

the input space spread out enough to make it infeasible for an attacker to try all possible input

values.

4.  Puzzle B will take longer to solve. The only way to solve these puzzle is to keep trying

different values of x until a value in Y is found. Thus, the time it takes to solve these puzzles depends

on the size of Y and Puzzle A has a larger Y than puzzle B. The length of id does not affect the number

of attempts needed to hit a target in Y.
